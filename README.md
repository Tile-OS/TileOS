# TileOS
### Modern Linux distribution based on Debian.

TileOS is a modern Linux distribution built on Debian Stable and using tiling window managers as its user interface. TileOS is perfect for both beginners who want to try tiling window manager environments and experienced Linux users who want a stable, comfortable and flexible keyboard-oriented user environment.

Development is currently focused on the TileOS [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) edition, which is the flagship edition. In the future, it is planned to add editions with the [River](https://github.com/riverwm/river), [Qtile](https://qtile.org/), [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) and [Bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) window managers. TileOS is a universal base for creating a distribution edition with any tiled window manager. Instructions on how to get started and submit your own TileOS flavor will be posted at a later date.
